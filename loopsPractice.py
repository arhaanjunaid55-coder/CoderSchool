# 1. we have a dictionary x, and we want to print out every value from x (For Each)
# 2. we want to grab input from user. and keep counting how many times we've grabbed input. until the user typed 'quit' (While)
# 3. we want to grab input and check whehter it is even or odd (If statemnet)
# 4. we want to print out every other element from dictionary x (Range)
